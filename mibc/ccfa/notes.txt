# this directory 'ccfa' mimics the /var/www/ccfa directory on ccfa01,02.
#
# files under ccfa/python are invoked via a wrapper script which is
# located under ccfa/scripts
#
# ccfa/python/venv contains a python environment that should be sourced
# prior to being run (this happens in the wrapper script listed above)
